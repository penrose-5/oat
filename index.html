                <h2>[ About ]</h2>
                <p>I'm William Wegener, originally from Switzerland, currently living in Denmark, where I work as a
                    quant trader in the renewable power market. Outside of work, you'll often find me sailing in
                    regattas, training for long-distance triathlons, or enjoying ski mountaineering in the Swiss Alps. And when I'm not in or on the water (or snow), I'm probably getting lost in a coding project or in a good novel.</p>

            <div class="work">
                <h2>[ Work ]</h2>
                <p>A more detailed section is coming soon! For now, here's the short version:</p>
                <p>My early career sits at the intersection of computer science, building projects from the ground up, and
                    finance. In 2019, I got my first hands-on experience at a top-tier global commodities trading firm
                    in Geneva, where I used my passion for coding to automate redundant processes. At the same
                    time, I gained deep insight into macro trading by setting up the analytics for a new proprietary trading desk from scratch.</p>
                <p>After that, I switched gears in 2023, spending a year as a developer and ad-interim team lead at <a
                        href="https://www.epfl.ch/schools/enac/about/data-at-enac/" target="_blank"
                        class="dashed">EPFL</a>, before moving last year to Denmark to join a trading scale-up
                    specializing in renewables — a role that perfectly blends my finance background with my knowledge in
                    computer science.

                <p>Oh, and why <span class="dash dashed">avoine.ch</span>?</p>
                <p>Oats (avoine in French) have fueled my ironman training over the past year. Now, as I shift my focus
                    toward long distance swimming, I'm still powered by one oatmeal at a time ;-)</p>
                <p>Okay, bye now!</p>
